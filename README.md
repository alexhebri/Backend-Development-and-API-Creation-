# Social Network API with Node.js / Social Network API Backend

This project is part of the Backend Development and API Creation course by Packt. It focuses on building and testing a backend for a social network application. The backend is developed using Node.js and Express, with data stored in MongoDB (via AtlasDB) and accessed through Mongoose. The project also features JWT-based authentication for secure user access and Postman testing for all API endpoints.
